# openfsd

**openfsd** is an open-source multiplayer flight simulation server implementing the modern VATSIM FSD protocol. It connects pilots and air traffic controllers in a shared virtual environment.

## About

Flight Sim Daemon (colloquially known as FSD) is the software/protocol responsible for connecting home flight simulator clients to a single, shared multiplayer world on hobbyist networks such as [VATSIM](https://vatsim.net/docs/about/about-vatsim) and [IVAO](https://www.ivao.aero/).
FSD was originally written in the late 90's by [Marty Bochane](https://github.com/kuroneko/fsd) for [SATCO](https://web.archive.org/web/20000619145015/http://www.satco.org/), later to be forked and taken closed-source by VATSIM in 2001.
As of May 2025, FSD is still used to facilitate over 140,000 active members connecting their flight simulators to the [network](https://vatsim-radar.com/).

## Features

- Facilitate multiplayer flight simulation with VATSIM protocol compatibility.
- Integrate web-based management for users, settings, and connections.
- Support SQLite and PostgreSQL for persistent storage.

## Quick Start with Docker

The preferred way to run openfsd is using **Docker** and **Docker Compose**. See the [Deployment Wiki](https://github.com/renorris/openfsd/wiki/Deployment).

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/renorris/openfsd.git
   cd openfsd
   ```

2. **Start with Docker Compose**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
   This launches the FSD server and web server sharing an SQLite database persisted in a named Docker volume. This setup will work great for most people running small servers.

3. **Configure the Server via Web Interface**:
    - Open `http://localhost:8000` in a browser.
    - Log in with the default administrator credentials (printed in the FSD server logs on first startup).
    - Navigate to the **Configure Server** menu
    - Set configuration values. See the [Configuration](https://github.com/renorris/openfsd/wiki/Configuration) wiki.

4. **Connect**:
   See the [Client Connection Wiki](https://github.com/renorris/openfsd/wiki/Client-Connection) for client-specific instructions.

## API

The web server exposes APIs under `/api/v1` for authentication, user management, and configuration. Although a basic web interface is provided, users are encouraged to call this API from their own external applications. See the [API](https://github.com/renorris/openfsd/tree/main/web) documentation.

## Docs

Unofficial reverse-engineered protocol documentation is included in this repository:

```
pip install mkdocs
git clone git@github.com:renorris/openfsd.git
cd openfsd/
mkdocs serve
```
